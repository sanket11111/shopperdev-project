1.Error Handling, 
  async error handling,( or even sync included)
  using express inbuilt err handler, i.e, middlewares of this sort= (req, res, next, err) 
  using next()
  using ErrorResponse class to build error objects on the fly taking an errormessage and status code

2. TO create efficient workflow and not doing pointless repititive stuff...helping yourself
   postman, creating folders and saving requests, saving req headers, global variables
    and retrrieving tokens that come along the response obj and saving them as well
   seeder file helps alot to clear the data from database and enter fresh data into it in one second
